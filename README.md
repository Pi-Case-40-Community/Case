# Pi Case 40  

Community modifications, accessories and designs for Cooler Master's Raspberry Pi Case - Pi Case 40 and its GPIO redirecting PCB  

## Housekeeping

 - Cloning: Everything is included as a submodule, so clone with ```git clone --recurse-submodules --remote-submodules https://github.com/Pi-Case-40-Community/PiCase40.git``` or ```git clone --recurse-submodules --remote-submodules git@github.com:Pi-Case-40-Community/PiCase40.git``` to get the repo with the latest version of each submodule.

 - Browsing: Submodules generally link to a specific commit, so while there is a way to get the latest version when cloning, this is not the case with browsing. When you click on a certain submodule, you will be redirected to its repo on that particular commit, so keep that in mind. When redirected to a repo, click its name in the top left, to start looking at its latest version.
