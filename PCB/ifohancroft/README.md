The PCB is not ready yet. I am uploading it so it can serve as a folder structure example.

The original repo can be found here [https://github.com/ifohancroft/PiCase40-GPIO-PCB](https://github.com/ifohancroft/PiCase40-GPIO-PCB). I will soon update this repo, to include it as a submodule, so there aren't two separate copies.
